			<h4>Start of project:</h4>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project was part of a friendly contest (HackDay) at my current place of employment: UCF's New Media Department. The purpose of HackDay is to build, demonstrate, or simply create a mock-up of an idea the employee believes would benefit the program but otherwise wouldn't get the chance to work on during normal work hours. This contest is held once a semester, and is most commonly done during paid work hours. Sadly, HackDay was my half day at work and due to additional reasons I couldn't work on it at work.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unwilling to let this opportunity slip through my fingers, I pulled an all-nighter and created an application using HTML/CSS/JavaScript and the graphics wrapper called ThreeJS, to create a widget that could be used to test a math class' students on the subject of trigonometry. This would, in theory, be a part of the New Media Department's core creation: Materia -- a platform for educational widgets created and used by teachers and students alike.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often times, a teacher's busy schedule or skepticism in the technology prevents them from creating an ever-changing body of questions for these widgets. My plan was to create a widget that auto-generated questions upon every instantiation by a student, and testing their answers as they came in. It was my hope to inspire a movement towards auto-generated widgets that would survive beyond a single semester, while continuing to provide new challenges to the player.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By peer vote, I ranked second place among all other HackDay submissions. Unfortunately being a contest hosted by my place of employment, the fully functioning application I had created isn't something I can provide a playable demo for. Due to proprietary concerns, I'm only able to offer this rough description, and the screenshots seen in the carousel of my main portfolio page at <a href="http://www.williamrobertfunk.com/#trig-driver" target="_blank">www.williamrobertfunk.com</a></p>

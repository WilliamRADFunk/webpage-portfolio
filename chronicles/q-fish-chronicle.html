			<h4>Start of project:</h4>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project is to learn how to create a character controller in JavaScript and Jquery. I will animate the character's movements at the basic level, and bind them to the character's movements. Though I'm aware there are graphics libraries out there that would make this process much simpler, I intend to use this as a learning experience; to learn the nuts and bolts. Later applications of this game may use a graphics library, but for now the goal is to have the fish swim left, right, up, and down using the arrow keys.</p>

			<h4>Mission accomplished:</h4>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were some interesting complications when dealing with sprite images, but I believe I ironed them out. The fish now swims with a very rudimentary animation. My wife, the artistic one, provided the sprite image map matching my specifications. I look forward to picking this back up for version 2.0 in the future. I want to add a graphics library and some automated fish. For now, though, the project has met my original goals.</p>

			<h4>A little extra:</h4>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to my wife adding a bit of color to the sprite map, I was able to give the fish a better look. This isn't a large enough change to warrant a new version, just thought it would have a better aesthetic appeal when someone does come looking.</p>

			<h4>Start of project:</h4>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to design an object-oriented application, a game in this instance, that possessed enough complexity to make poor design a guarantee for failure. This will also be the first real programming application I've completed. I've done the "hello world!" of basic dice and card games, but these are typically cookie-cutter examples that serve as practice and less as demonstration of ability. It is my hope that this project will not only strengthen my C++ skills, but bolster my ability to plan out the application in advance.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've elected to break this game into manageable components, intuitively real-world objects: Calendar, Theater, Cinema, Movie, RandomEvent, and then rudimentary controllers RandomEventHandler and DecisionMaker. There's a Global for a few functions basic and widely used enough to warrant a universal home. Inside these large superclasses, I've put everything from instantiation to manipulation.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In researching best-practices, I've seen more efficient ways to layout a program. Something like MVC comes to mind. However, as this is my first attempt at a large-scale program, I need to start somewhere that my limited experience can launch from. Let the journey begin!</p>

			<h4>Using Github:</h4>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the recommendation of a friend, and experienced programming professional, I've opened a Github account and pushed what I have so far into a remote repository. I will use this to keep track of any changes I make along the way. Already, keeping track of my code in this project has become cumbersome. Having a safety net such as this will give me greater confidence to experiment with more complex ideas.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regards to the game itself, I've more or less completed the classes themselves. Syntax of C++ has caused me to stumble a number of times, but thus far I find a strongly typed language gratifying. I take solace knowing that what I've coded (assuming I didn't make a mistake) will be how the program responds.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this stage, I am adding content as well. What the snacks, promotions, and upgrades are and how much they cost and affect the cinema's profit margin. Since this is a text-based game, I've also began to format the output to make it more human reader friendly. One cool feature I've learned is in using text files as a way to give player control over their own game content. Both movies and random events (I've pre-written enough to give the game life) are in respective text files. The player can change title, synopsis, or stats if they desired. The game at start-up, reads from these text files and populates the relevant objects.</p>

			<h4>Launch:</h4>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After squashing bugs with the biggest roll of newspaper I could find, I believe I worked out all the kinks and have pushed the final changes into my Github repository. Aside from updating the content in the text files, I took the opportunity to document the code internally. I've done this as part of my process, but now that it's finished I've made sure any deprecated comments were removed and any obscure functionality had at least a small explanation.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that after looking at all the games out there that mine is simple and perhaps silly. Despite that, I find this project to be a tremendous confidence booster for my coding abilities. The game itself may never be played by anyone other than myself, but it does what I set out to make it do...and that is the point, after all.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Final note: I tweaked many of the features to make it more challenging. This is merely comes down to altering costs and the odds of bad events occurring. In case someone does play it one day, I want it to at least have a chance at providing a challenge.</p>

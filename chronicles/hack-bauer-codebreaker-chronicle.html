			<h4>Start of project:</h4>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project will incorporate a number of new elements. I intend to create a stealth, first-person POV game that requires the player to collect a certain number of data nodes on each of a number of levels. When finished, they must reach the top floor computer and break a small encryption cipher. All this would be happening under the constraint of a timer, and roaming enemies.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aspects experimented with for the first time: AI algorithms for patrol(), seek(), chase(), flee(), etc. The basics of AI bots. This will be rendered using Three.js. Optional tool will be a new physics engine Cannon.js. I want to avoid the overhead if I can manage without it, but it will depend on how much time and effort a custom collision detector will take to build. I only have 5 days to complete the bulk of the game, and this time constraint will govern many of my design decisions.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another experiment will be the use of simple webworkers for popup modals to illustrate to the player that the scene is loading. This will be used in the very beginning as well as level changes. HUD displays will show a top-down minimap of the player's position on the level as well as that of walls, data nodes, and enemy bots.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My main interest will be in the AI bot algorithms. I may need to work with raycasters to judge distance to objects, aid in object avoidance and detection, and pathfinding. I'm aware that many of these elements are a bit </p>

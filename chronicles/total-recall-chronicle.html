			<h4>Start of project:</h4>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project will serve two purposes: one is to learn JavaScript and to create a demonstration of that understanding; the other is to have something to present at a group interview I've been given at the University of Central Florida's Center for Distributed Learning Department. The requisites for that job are well-beyond my current abilities, and my only hope for success is to demonstrate my ability to learn and understand new concepts in a condensed period of time. It is my hope that this simple game (paired with another game - TicTacToe 2D) will show I can pick up a new language and create something relevant with it.</p>

			<h4>Knee Deep:</h4>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project started off easily enough. Using HTML/CSS to create a list in the shape of a 4 x 4 box was straight forward. JavaScript with Jquery made the activation of each card easy to manage. The click event listeners are simple to use and there's plenty of documentation throughout the internet to manipulate it the way I want. However, I've discovered what I think will be a key feature in making this game stand out a little bit more. I found third-party code that creates a small flip animation. This would allow me to show the backs of the cards, and they would flip in a cool way at the click of a mouse. Only problem is that not all browsers support this code as it is. I need to find a way to adapt it for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and at least IE11. IE seems to be the biggest troublemaker.</p>

			<h4>Launch:</h4>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victory!</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After many a sleepless night, and trying not to let my school work suffer, I managed to use tools like -webkit- to tweak the code for each browser. Still that was not enough. In the end, I did discover a way to logically detect browser type in the HTML document, and use that to alter the code accordingly. This looks to have solved this pain in my...</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have tested the program in all the browsers I could get my hands on, and as many mobile devices too. Any small bugs I saw pop up have been squashed. It's as good as it's going to get before the interview. Fingers crossed!</p>

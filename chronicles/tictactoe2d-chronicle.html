			<h4>Start of project:</h4>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project will serve two purposes: one is to learn JavaScript and to create a demonstration of that understanding; the other is to have something to present at a group interview I've been given at the University of Central Florida's Center for Distributed Learning Department. The requisites for that job are well-beyond my current abilities, and my only hope for success is to demonstrate my ability to learn and understand new concepts in a condensed period of time. It is my hope that this simple game (paired with another game - Total Recall) will show I can pick up a new language and create something relevant with it.</p>

			<h4>Logic &amp; Function:</h4>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm surprised at how fast this project has come along. The documentation out there on the world wide web for Jquery has given me everything I needed to create the functionality for this game. My understanding of C/C++ helped in how to structure the various functions, but it was a book I read "The Pragmatic Programmer" by Hunt &amp; Thomas that really helped me organize my code in a way that helped me keep track. I believe it was this that allowed me to move so quickly from start to finish.</p>

			<h4>Launch Time:</h4>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bugs weren't many, but I squished the few I did find. As far as I can tell, the game is ready to present. With the time I saved on this project I believe I can actually finish the other game (Total Recall) in time. It would be great to have two small games to present. Nothing hits home better than two demonstrations that I can learn and work quickly.</p>
